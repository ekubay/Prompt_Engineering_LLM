# Prompt Engineering: In-context learning with GPT-3 and other Large Language Models 
## Entity Extraction
Extracting a piece of information from text is a common need in language processing systems. LLMs can extract entities which are harder to extract using other NLP methods (and where pre-training provides the model with some context on these entities). This is an overview of using generative LLMs to extract entities.
